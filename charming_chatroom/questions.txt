1) What is a socket?
    An endpoint for communication in a network node.

2) What is the difference between the domains AF_INET and AF_UNIX?
    AF_UNIX is for local communication,
    AF_INET is for IPv4 internet protocols

3) What is the difference between SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_DGRAM?
    SOCK_STREAM provides sequenced, reliable, two-way, connection-based byte streams.
    SOCK_DGRAM supports datagrams (connectionless, unreliable messages of a fiexed maximum length)

4) Why is it important to clear all the values the addrinfo struct before using it in getaddrinfo?
    You do not know what the values of the struct are otherwise (especially in long running programs that are reusing stack memory)

5) What are ai_family and ai_socktype?
    ai_family specifies which type of addressing to use local, IPv4, IPv6
    ai_socktype specifies which type of connection to use (TCP vs UDP)

6) What does getaddrinfo do?


7) What does connect do?


8) What is setsockopt?


9) What does bind do?


10) What does listen do?
